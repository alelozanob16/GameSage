# GameSage

AI agent project based on crewAI in which two agents communicate to recommend the best video games based on user input.

To launch the api:
uvicorn (you must install it if you don`t have it) api_name(file):app --reload(in order to keep it updated)

To try the endpoint:
localhost:8000/docs

1 Research about video games based on the input
2 Recommend some video games based on the research we've already done

To see the results based on the agents work just go to "output"
